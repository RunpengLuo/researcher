## Hello! 你好！

<img class="profile-picture" src="files/selfies.jpg">

I'm a 2024 Fall incoming Computer Science PhD student at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu). Currently, I'm a full-time R&D Solution Developer at [Diversity Arrays Technology](https://www.diversityarrays.com) and a casual technical assistant at [Team Schwessinger](https://teamschwessinger.com). I graduated with a major in Computer Science and a specialisation in Systems&Architecture from the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au) in Dec 2023.

My research interest lies in computational biology, where I develop novel algorithms for applications in bioinformatics and computational genomics. 
For now, I'm focusing on developing combinatorial algorithms to solve genome assembly and haplotype phasing problems. You can check my résumé [here](files/Runpeng_Luo_Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
