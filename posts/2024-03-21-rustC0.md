## C0 - Learning Rust
#### Mar 20th, 2024 at Canberra, ACT, Australia
This blog is intended to record some interesting findings and mark the milestones during the progress of learning the Rust programming language. 

Since my main programming languages are Python and C, I also had a bunch of chances to play around with Java, Haskell, and C++. I won't go into details to annotate tiny little details but focus on some new ideas compared to the other programming languages that surprised me.

Generally, I'm following the [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html). Once I finish all the examples, I'll employ Rust for the prototype developments! (How excited!)
